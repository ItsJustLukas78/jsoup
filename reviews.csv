JingHongHuang,August 14 2023,Great Birdies,The birdies last a LOT longer than I expected, even after a few matches and fast smashes, they hold their own. I have been playing avidly for a few months with them and they lived up to the standard of the Yonex brand.,5.0 out of 5 stars,true
Sri,December 31 2020,Durable and closest to the feather shuttle,These Mavis 2000 are the closest to the real feather shuttle. My team mates said these shuttles are rotating in the flight after one game so switched to Mavis 350s as they are used to that model but I did not observe that issue. I like it's durability. If you are ordering two packs, try one pack of 350s foe better smashes and one pack of 2000s for closeness to real birdies.,4.0 out of 5 stars,true
Chuck,February 7 2024,Finally found a shuttlecock with some spring,,I’ve been reading reviews and bought these and I’m very happy especially for the price. They have a nice ping to it and can hit pretty hard lightweight, but they will be great this summer.,5.0 out of 5 stars,true
Chenny,June 7 2020,Durable alternative to feather Shuttlecock,These shuttlecocks are great! We are recreational players at home. I bought a dozen feather ones before. Each feather shuttlecock broke after about 40min of playing (feathers are torn or broken off). We gone through those way too quickly, so I started looking for more durable alternatives. The Yonex shuttlecock feels almost the same as the feather ones we played, yet has lasted multiple play sessions, still in as new condition. The only slight draw back maybe that when the shuttlecock is flying, these ones is slightly harder to see than the feather ones. But it is not a big deal after you get used to it. Definitely recommend for recreational playing at least.,5.0 out of 5 stars,true

Kindle Customer,April 21 2022,A bit too fast for medium speed birdies,I think these birdies are bit too fast for medium speed birdies. The overall quality is good.,4.0 out of 5 stars,true
R. Reed,October 27 2016,Great shuttlecocks,These are the best. We use them for frequent play in the front yard, it gets crazy, smashing it really high etc. these are very sturdy. They fly really good. Easy to see. We have gone through many shuttlecocks, we like these the most. I would order them again.,5.0 out of 5 stars,true
Sunny,August 4 2020,Excellent life and play quality,We play outdoor regularly, 3 days a week, and these shuttles have been performing very well. Will buy again.,5.0 out of 5 stars,true
SM,May 25 2021,Excellent product. Definitely for regular players,Though playing with goose feathers is 'hip', they break quickly and needs to be stored in specific ways. These nylon ones are about as good and lasts a lot longer then feathers.,5.0 out of 5 stars,true
cmctyl,June 15 2018,Not as good as expected,I am not sure my received yellow 2000 version is genuine or not (also because I can't find this version on the official website but someone says it does exist). The main problem is that these shuttles do not fly "normally", far from a feather shuttle, even a 350 nylon shuttle flies much better than this one and it does not seem to be a medium speed shuttle as well.,3.0 out of 5 stars,true
